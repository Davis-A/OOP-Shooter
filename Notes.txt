Questions:

Where should i spawn enemies?  Design question.
	Factory.  Static interface.  Spawn phase 1 enemy, spawn phase 2 enemy

	Have something deal with time.




How would i do a quasi random spawn:
	Static timeobject for timekeeping (singleton pattern)
	The time object handles timing, it tells factory what to spawn.  ie the timeobject knows to spawn 4 enemies in phase 1.
	Time object in main.  Has a method to tick each cycle, use the tick to measure time

	Timing.
	After x seconds Spawn lvl1,
	After y seconds Spawn lvl2,
	maybe frame numbers?	



How to do collisions?
	physics manager


__________
	gamemanager
		create singletons
		HandleInput (invoke objects to handle their input ie player)
		Update (tell all objects to update() -- during update it has a 
		Render Tell all objects to render.
		
singletons:
	during update it has a HandleCollisions methods 
	Collision manager (is passed all gameobjects by GameManager)
	time man
	factory
	graphics manager

class physics
	private TimeManager _timeman;
	private factory _factory;



__________________________________-

When the Time manager tells factory to spawn an enemy.  Does the factory put it into the list of enemies, OR does the factory return the enemy to put into the list of enemeies?  Thus the heart of this question is which of the singletons have a reference to the list of enemies.

PhysicsManager needs a method to allow the factory to add an enemy to it.

Collision.  Create a boundry box.  Ie if the ship is at 50,50.  Swingame has SwinGame.RectanglesIntersect()

_______________
ProcessInput for player:
	deltaX = 0; deltaY = 0;
	if (wkey down)
		deltaY = deltaY - speed;
	if (skey down)
		deltaY = deltaY + speed;


______
Enemy	
	lifetime integer
	struct DeltaX/Y {dx, dy}
	List of DeltaX/Y
	Each update, increment lifetime
	when lifetime hits 100 (arbitrary value)
	If (arbitrary value)
		tempdelta = dxdyList.remove();
		deltaX = tempdelta.x
		deltaY = tempdelta.Y

	Each update increment lifetime
	when lifetime hits 100 change dxdy to next dictionary item.

____________

____________
Despawn
	Enemy
		if (X < 0-ScreenWidth()) || (X > (ScreenWidth()) * 2 )) || (Y < 0-ScreenHeight()) || (Y > ScreenWidth() *2)  THEN Despawn()

	Bullet
		if (X < 0-Radius) || (X > ScreenWidth() + Radius) || (Y < 0-Radius) || (Y > ScreenHeight()+Radius) THEN Despawn()

Questions:
I currently have magic numbers in things like my guns.  Biggun has a magic 50 and 10 it passes to its base constructor to be the size and speed of the bullets it shoots.  And a magical 0 in it's SpawnBullet() method to give the bullet constructor a deltaY





///////////



Testing ideas:

spawn enemies (or bullets), give them deltas.  Create loop for x iterations and then check enemy X/Y location
spawn enemy and bullet.  Set them on a collision course after x iterations, check they have collided

Enemy movement patterns.  Check the delta of enemies after x iterations (enough that it triggers their next movement delta).

JUST HD THINGS

Modify Swingame Rectangle to be a class instead of an object.  Then i can have a constructor that accepts X,Y, height & width instead of just an empty one and then modifying it with properties.  This could lead me to having a uniform way to create the rectangle regardless of it being a bullet or Ship.  Also could lead to a single Update() method for all gameobjects too.
