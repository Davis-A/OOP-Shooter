Sound.  Should i make something akin to the Graphics Manager
	This could be challenging 

When a bullet collides.  The Enemy should check if it is alive.  Then If it dies trigger sound AND it should call the MemeoryManager to remove itself.  This removes the need for the GameManager IsEnemyDead() loop;

-----Change Check for deathing.  THe object should have a way to check if it dies.  

Keep bitmaps in factory.


i still need to add something to reset the game when the player hp <1


Interfaces "collidable":  Has collided.  From collission handler.  When a bullet and enemy collide they should call a method "has collided" which can be enforced by an interface.  Where the enemy then removehp() amidead() return boolean. Then remove.
Whereas bullets simply remove themselves when entering hascollided()



Phase object:
So time manager just tells phaseList[0] to update()
Where phase object update() decrementts timer.  When timer reaches 0.  Then phase occurs (ie calls factory to spawn) then removes itself from the list.




Things i need to make my game HD worthy:
	Hud?  Maybe the lives of the player represented as small player ship sprites at the bottom?
	The enemy movement patterns could be loaded in from a file.  

	Any other thoughts?
